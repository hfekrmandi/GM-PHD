%GM_PHD_Simulate_Measurements
%Matlab code by Bryan Clarke b.clarke@acfr.usyd.edu.au 

%This file generates simulated measurement data for the linear KF simulation
%described in Vo&Ma. There is a nonlinear simulation described in the paper
%but I have not gotten around to implementing it.
%The sensor measurements are range-bearing measurements, similar to those
%from an FMCW radar. The expected error magnitude is independent of
%measurement (i.e. range error is not proportional to range, bearing error
%is not proportional to bearing). 

%There will be gaussian noise on the measurement and Poisson-distributed clutter
%in the environment. 
%Note: It is possible to get no measurements if the target is not detected
%and there is no clutter

%If you want to use this PHD filter implementation for another problem, you
%will need to replace this script with another one that populates Z,
%zTrue, and simMeasurementHistory (Z is used in a lot of the update code,
%zTrue and simMeasurementHistory are used in GM_PHD_Simulate_Plot, and 
%simMeasurementHistory is used in GM_EKF_PHD_Create_Birth)

%There will be gaussian noise on the measurement and Poisson clutter
%in the environment. 
%Note: It is possible to get no measurements if the target is not detected
%and there is no clutter
