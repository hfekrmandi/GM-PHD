%GM_EKF_PHD_Simulate_Initialise
%Matlab code by Bryan Clarke b.clarke@acfr.usyd.edu.au 

%We implement the simulation described in example 1 of Vo&Ma 2006, the one
%designed for the linear KF PHD filter. Although a second, different
%example is listed for the EKF version, I haven't gotten around to
%implementing it yet.

%Most of this is unchanged from the example used in the linear KF PHD
%filter. The big changes for the EKF are in
%GM_EKF_PHD_Initialise_Jacobians.

%% Control parameters
x_sensor = [0; 0; 0];%The position of the simulated range-bearing sensor. Heading 0 is along the positive X-axis. Counter clockwise is positive, clockwise is negative, bearings are bounded -pi < theta <= pi
noiseScaler = 1.0;%Adjust the strength of the noise on the measurements by adjusting this
nClutter = 50; %Assume constant 50 clutter measurements. Since clutter is Poisson distrbuted it might be more accurate to use nClutter = poissrnd(50) if you have the required Matlab toolbox. Constant 50 clutter works well enough for simulation purposes.

%% Target parameters
endTime = 100;%Duration of main loop.
